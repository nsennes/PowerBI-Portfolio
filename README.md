# üñ•Ô∏è PowerBI-Portfolio
Welcome to my Power BI Projects Portfolio! üöÄ
This is where I dive into data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data modeling, and storytelling with data‚Äîall while learning how to bring numbers to life. Through working on case studies, I‚Äôve had the chance to build interactive dashboards, uncover trends, and practice solving real-world-inspired problems.

I see this portfolio as a growing space to experiment, learn, and improve. I‚Äôm always excited to take on new challenges and explore new datasets to push my skills even further.‚ú®

### **3) Customer Purchase Trend Analysis** (Project)
This case study focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior to uncover actionable insights into demographics, product preferences, and purchasing patterns.

### üé• Preview



- **What I Did**:
  - Explored customer shopping data to analyze demographics, product preferences, and purchase patterns.
  - Highlighted key insights, such as:
     - More male customers compared to female customers.
     - Most customers fall in the 25‚Äì29 age group.
     - "Every 3 Months" is the most common purchase frequency.
  - Designed a dynamic overview page to present these insights clearly and engagingly.
  - Developed a drill-down exploration page to analyze key factors influencing shopping behavior, such as payment methods, shipping preferences, and subscription status.
  - Applied DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated measures, enhancing the depth and accuracy of the analysis.

- **What I Learned**:
  - How to effectively approach **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and storytelling to uncover actionable insights.
  - The importance of creating **interactive dashboards** to make data accessible and understandable for users.
