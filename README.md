# 🖥️ PowerBI-Portfolio
Welcome to my Power BI Projects Portfolio! 🚀
This is where I dive into data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data modeling, and storytelling with data—all while learning how to bring numbers to life. Through working on case studies, I’ve had the chance to build interactive dashboards, uncover trends, and practice solving real-world-inspired problems.

I see this portfolio as a growing space to experiment, learn, and improve. I’m always excited to take on new challenges and explore new datasets to push my skills even further.✨

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

### **1) Analyzing Customer Churn** (Case Study)
This case study focuses on understanding customer churn behavior, uncovering key reasons for churn, and identifying actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

- **What I Did**:
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine customer demographics, churn rates, and distribution across categories.
  - Investigated churn patterns based on factors like contract type, account length, payment methods, and demographics.
  - Built interactive dashboards to present insights, including churn reasons, churn rate by state, and churn rate trends.

- **What I Learned**:
  - How to use DAX for advanced calculations, such as calculating churn rates and comparing averages.
  - The importance of creating clean, actionable visualizations for stakeholders.
  - A systematic approach to analyzing customer behavior and presenting findings effectively.
