# üñ•Ô∏è PowerBI-Portfolio
Welcome to my Power BI Projects Portfolio! üöÄ
This is where I dive into data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data modeling, and storytelling with data‚Äîall while learning how to bring numbers to life. Through working on case studies and projects, I‚Äôve had the chance to build interactive dashboards, uncover trends, and practice solving real-world-inspired problems.

I see this portfolio as a growing space to experiment, learn, and improve. I‚Äôm always excited to take on new challenges and explore new datasets to push my skills even further.‚ú®
